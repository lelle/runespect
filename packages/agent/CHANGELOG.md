### Patch Changes

- [#4](https://github.com/lelle/runespect/pull/4) [`80755eb`](https://github.com/lelle/runespect/commit/80755ebf0e6c6cf5f74c36f9ebc939852415d091) Thanks [@lelle](https://github.com/lelle)! - Highlight and pick the instance you point at, also in a list. A component that renders several
  elements side by side marked the elements of its first instance, and after rows left a list and came
  back, a row could mark another row. The plugin now tells the agent which instance renders each
  element, instead of the agent guessing from the order of files and elements in the page, and the
  highlight covers all of an instance's elements, not only its first.

- [#6](https://github.com/lelle/runespect/pull/6) [`6580267`](https://github.com/lelle/runespect/commit/6580267adfa86ce4b1d7b70ce1f3e902ea7635da) Thanks [@lelle](https://github.com/lelle)! - While picking, the box covers the instance a click picks, not the element under the pointer, and
  nothing where a click would pick nothing. The box carries the component's name, also when a row in
  the tree is hovered.

- [#7](https://github.com/lelle/runespect/pull/7) [`7ae2f1e`](https://github.com/lelle/runespect/commit/7ae2f1e4e1bbfa20693a2e855eeceb25da368883) Thanks [@lelle](https://github.com/lelle)! - Say so when `@runespect/ui` and `@runespect/vite-plugin` are not the same version. The overlay runs
  on the plugin's agent, and another version may lack what it calls: the dev server now warns in the
  terminal, and the overlay shows a notice instead of the tree, also next to an agent from 0.1.0.

## 0.1.0

First release.
